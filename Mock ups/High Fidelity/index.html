				<h1>What is this unit about?</h1>
				<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>
This unit gives you the opportunity, under close guidance appropriate to the project, to apply and extend the knowledge and skills gained in your course to date to a substantial project. You will have the opportunity to gain knowledge and skills required for careful planning, scope control and task management to ensure the success of a industry-oriented project. You will undertake critical tasks required in the early stages of a project, such as: initial concept development and feasibility analysis, requirements gathering and analysis, design and project planning. These activities will culminate in the delivery of an initial version of the project deliverable (e.g., software prototype, design document, literature review, environmental scan, research plan, etc.) to stakeholders as a proposal for further development in the unit IFB399 Capstone Project (Phase 2).</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>
This unit, together with IFB399 Capstone Project (Phase 2), allows you to extend your professional skills by taking a substantial industry-oriented project from concept to completion. The successful project will provide tangible evidence of your skill and mastery of information technology by applying the knowledge and skills learnt in earlier units. This unit extends your knowledge and skills at both a technical and professional level. More specifically, it extends your technical skills within your area(s) of specialisation and enhances your professional skill of planning and monitoring a major project. You will become more familiar with professional communication and documentation within a project, producing formal reports according to agreed standards, and developing your ability to present to a professional audience. You will also have opportunities to better understand your personal learning, decision making and information gathering styles. You will understand the use of project management tools, methods and decision making.</p>

<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>
The key focus of the capstone project is for you to demonstrate your ability, as a soon to be graduated IT professional, to execute a substantial industry-oriented project. You will pull together what you have learnt throughout your degree and show how you have integrated the skills and knowledge from previous units. You will further develop critical professional skills of working with people from a range of backgrounds and project management skills of planning, scope control and task management in ensuring that the project is successful.</p>

				<p>Capstone Week 8 Update<br>
 					Posted on: Tuesday, 12 September 2017 9:52:49 PM AEST<br>
					Good evening all, We are now in week 8, and in the middle of the mid-semester presentations. It is interesting to see the progress you have made so far, and we hope that the feedback you receive is useful in setting clear and specific expectations for your project. (If still in doubt, feel free to contact us) Thanks to everyone who completed the 'continuous Pulse' for week 7.We are aiming to give you feedback by the end of the week (so that you can revise your plan if needed). The online material for this week focuses on data modelling & database design. Like in recent weeks, it is prepared as a Storify. It is relatively long, so we have released it early. It is available in this week's folder under Learning Resources. Remember that we have another drop-in session on Thursday (10am-12pm, P421) if you have any question.<br>
					As always, you can also email us at <b>IT.capstone@qut.edu.au.</b><br>
					Have a good week.<br><br>
					Regards,<br>

					Dimitri

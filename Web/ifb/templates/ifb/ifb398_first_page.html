        <h2>IFB398 : Capstone Project (Phase 1)</h2>
        <br><h3>Welcome to IFB398</h3>
        Posted on: Monday, 24 July 2017 1:40:02 AM AEST

        <br><br><br>Dear Students,

        <br><br>A warm welcome to all of you joining us in IFB398 Capstone Phase 1 this semester. The Blackboard site has just gone live, and you are encouraged to read through the Capstone Guide which is located under Unit Details. This semester IFB398 is being run by Dimitri Perrin, Anthony Deacon and Guido Zuccon from the School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. Prakash Bhandari from the School of Information Systems runs IFB399, the second phase of Capstone.

        <br><br>If you need to email us please use the email address: IT.capstone@qut.edu.au. There are four coordinators for IT Capstone due to its complexity, so your email might get missed unless you direct it appropriately. We have also setup a Facebook group for the unit here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/itcapstone17sem2/

        <br><br>The IT Capstone is designed to bring together the skills you have learnt in your degree and provide an experience that assists in your transition to the workplace. Each student who undertakes capstone will be working in a group of four students, which you are able to nominate if you so choose. Once you have formed your group you will apply for a project to work on for both IFB398 and IFB399. Projects are awarded to groups in a competitive fashion, and your application for 2 or more projects will form the basis of your first assessment (although if you apply for more than 2 projects, only 2 applications will be marked for the assessment). Projects from industry and from within the university are available, and groups who are unsuccessful in securing one of these projects will be allocated to a "backup" project that has been written by Alex Ghiculescu from TANDA. You are able to propose your own project if you wish.

        <br><br>Because Capstone is largely a work integrated learning experience, it does not run like a normal unit with lectures and tutorials each week. In particular you should note:

        <br><br>On Thursday July 27th, 10am-12pm in P-421 we will hold a lecture. In this lecture we will discuss how the unit operates.
        <br>By default, teams are automatically generated. If you have a team already formed, you have the option of sending us that information (by Friday July 28th) and opting out of the automated process.
        <br>On Sunday July 29th we will release the final group allocations for the unit.
        <br>On Thursday August 3rd in P-421 we will be holding a marketplace where you can see some of the industry projects on offer.
        <br>During Week 2 we will be holding a number of drop-in sessions to assist with preparing your applications for projects. Times will be announced in the first lecture.
        <br>On Sunday August 6th project applications are due.
        <br>During Weeks 2-4 there will also be a number of online modules you have to complete. The aim of these modules is to provide you with the foundation knowledge to apply for jobs, assess your skills and knowledge gaps, and understand project management to a level appropriate for this unit. Some of this learning will build on what you have done previously in IFB299. By the end of week 2 you will need to submit your project applications, which is also your first assessment (worth 5% of the unit). At the end of weeks 3 and 4, you will need to complete a quiz. They are intended for self-assessment, and are therefore not graded. However, it is important that you complete them. To ensure this, your team will not receive its project allocation until each member has completed these non-graded quizzes. After this we will provide some further learning resources throughout the semester, however these are intended only to improve your knowledge, rather than form the basis of an assessment. These resources we hope will also be useful for you when planning your project, and will set-out the minimum expectations for some forms of work.

        <br><br>It is important to note in this unit we want your project to be your own, and run your way. Although we require you to choose and adopt a valid project management approach, which one you pick and the technologies you use to support it are up to you. We have found this to be a much more rewarding experience for students and our industry partners.

        <br><br>All of us greatly look forward to meeting everyone over the next two weeks.

        <br><br>Regards,
        <br>The IT Capstone Team
